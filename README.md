# scittle-kitchen

More plugin builds for [scittle](https://github.com/babashka/scittle).

## Usage

Include the desired plugin build in your HTML page:

```html
<script src="https://timothypratley.github.io/scittle-kitchen/js/scittle.js"></script>
<script src="https://timothypratley.github.io/scittle-kitchen/js/scittle.dataspex.js"></script>
```

To see all available plugins, browse the [`plugin-templates.edn`](plugin-templates.edn) file or the `plugins/` and `scittle/plugins/` directories. Each plugin will have a corresponding JS file published to GitHub Pages and can be included via a `<script src=...>` tag as shown above. TODO: make a list appear here or somewhere.

## Rationale

Scittle plugins are powerful, but building them from source can be a barrier for new users and plugin authors.
By providing precompiled plugins and a shared build/release process, we lower the entry barrier for adoption and contribution.
This central place for building and releasing plugins can make the ClojureScript ecosystem more accessible from Scittle.

## Goals

- Publish precompiled plugins ready for immediate use
- Encourage and support community-contributed plugins
- Stay up-to-date with upstream Scittle releases
- Avoid interfering with Scittleâ€™s normal build and release process
- **Endorsement to help with plugin adoption and visibility**
  - Under the babashka organization
  - Linked from Scittle's README
- Minimize maintenance burden on @borkdude
- Automate the release process
- Keep up with latest Scittle releases
- Keep up with latest plugin dependencies
- Support multiple scittle.js builds with different plugin sets

## Contributing

Pull requests are invited.
Add new plugins in [`plugin-templates.edn`](plugin-templates.edn) or create a new directory in `plugins/`.
For most libraries, just add an entry to [`plugin-templates.edn`](plugin-templates.edn).

## Development

Releases are done as a github Action, which pushes to the `gh-pages` branch, which is published by GitHub Pages.
See [.github/workflows/release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml).
While developing, you can run the build locally by checking out the latest Scittle code (the GitHub Action does this automatically) `git submodule update --init --remote`,
running `bb -f generate_plugins.clj` to generate the plugins and `deps.edn` in `all/`,
then running `bb -d all -f build.clj release`.

## Build Process Design

To build Scittle (and plugins), ensure that scittle and all the plugins you want are on the classpath,
and invoke the scittle build function: `(build/build)`.
Scittle discovers plugins by scanning the classpath for plugin descriptors,
and produces javascript files in `resources/public/js`.

Below details how `scittle-kitchen` achieves this situation by preparing the deps for a build.

- **Local Scittle Dependency:**
  Problem: we want to use the latest version of Scittle and be able to run `build/build` and find `scittle/plugins`.
  Solution: use a git submodule and a `:local/root "scittle"` dependency.
  Note that `:local/root "scittle/build"` is also required as a dependency as that is not included in just scittle.
  When run as a GitHub Action, the workflow always checks out the latest Scittle code from your repository,
  so builds and plugins are always up-to-date with the most recent changes.

- **SCI Version Synchronization:**
  Problem: there is a conflict between the SCI Maven version and the Scittle git dependency of SCI.
  Solution: the build script copies the version of `org.babashka/sci` from `scittle/deps.edn` to ensure compatibility. Without this, the build will fail.

- **Automatic Plugin Generation:**
  Problem: we want to avoid boilerplate and make it easy to add new plugins.
  Solution: the [`build.clj`](build.clj) script generates plugins from a concise data description in [`plugin-templates.edn`](plugin-templates.edn).
  This works for simple plugins.
  For most libraries, just to `plugin-templates.edn`.
  If your plugin requires more complex setup, you can create a full plugin directory in `plugins/` rather than generating it,
  or we can add optional fields to the template in the future.

- **Automatic Plugin Discovery:**
  Problem: in order to add plugins to the classpath, we need to find them and create a `deps.edn`.
  Solution: directories in `plugins/` and `scittle/plugins/` (excluding `demo`) are detected as dependencies.
  New plugins are included in the build without changes to the build process.

- **Separate build directories:**
  Problem: we want to be able to build different versions of Scittle with different plugin sets.
  Solution: [`build.clj`](build.clj) can generate multiple build directories with different sets of plugins.
  Each build directory has its own `deps.edn` and `bb.edn`.
  Note that both are required. scittle/build is babashka only, so it needs to be in `bb.edn`.
  `deps.edn` is required when scittle/build launches Clojure to do the shadow-cljs build.
  The default build is `all`, which includes all plugins.
  Inside that directory, `bb release` will produce a build with all plugins. This enables easy experimentation and custom builds.

- **Future Improvements:**
  - It might be better to have the build process checkout the latest Scittle code itself,
    rather than relying on the GitHub Action to do so.
  - Support versioned builds, e.g. `all-0.4.0`, `official-0.4.0`, etc.
  - Think about using latest versions of the libraries that plugins depend on.
    Right now, they are pinned in `plugin-templates.edn`.
  - Publish to NPM or a CDN

## Alternatives considered

- Could be part of the scittle repo itself, as a different build task.
  NO: adds too much maintenance burden on @borkdude
- [https://github.com/scicloj/scittle](https://github.com/scicloj/scittle) is a fork instead of using submodule.
  NO: harder to keep up with latest Scittle changes, not clear how to add plugins.
- Publishing to NPM or CDN. YES (soon): could be done in addition to GitHub Pages.
- How to update plugin dependencies? TBD for now they are pinned in `plugin-templates.edn`.
  Could be done automatically by checking for new versions on Clojars.
- Should plugin builds be versioned? TBD for now there will just be a global version I think.
- Shouldn't all plugins have their own directory/edn file? YES to enable standalone building.
  But we can make it more convenient by generating from a template.
- Should it produce scittle-kitchen.js or just scittle.js or several flavors (is there an advantage to excluding plugins)? TBD. I think it should have a different name to avoid confusion with the official scittle.js.
