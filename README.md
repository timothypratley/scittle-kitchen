# scittle-kitchen

More plugins for [scittle](https://github.com/babashka/scittle).

## Usage

Include `scittle.js` and the desired plugin(s) in your HTML page:

```html
<script src="https://timothypratley.github.io/scittle-kitchen/js/scittle.js"></script>
<script src="https://timothypratley.github.io/scittle-kitchen/js/scittle.geom.js"></script>
```

See [the release page](https://timothypratley.github.io/scittle-kitchen/) for the full list of published plugins.

> [!NOTE]
> Only scittle-kitchen `scittle.js` can load these plugins.

## Rationale

We can lower the entry barrier to try ClojureScript libraries by publishing precompiled plugins.
My main hope is that more plugins leads to more experiments.
That's what I really love about Scittle, being able to just try things without using a build tool.

You can load `.cljs` files in Scittle as scripts.
But many ClojureScript libraries have multiple namespaces and npm dependencies,
which prevents their use in Scittle.
Scittle plugins are compiled JavaScript from the ClojureScript library, ready to use in Scittle.

Only a few plugins are included in the official Scittle distribution.
Other plugins need to be built in a special way to be usable in Scittle.
This is a barrier for users, and plugin authors.

`scittle-kitchen` is a build and release process that publishes plugins in a publically accessible location.
It uses a git submodule to always build against the latest Scittle,
and automatically discovers plugins in the community contributed [`plugin-templates.edn`](plugin-templates.edn),
`plugins/` directory, and official `scittle/plugins/`.

The plugin template avoids the tedious boilerplate normally required to add a new plugin.
All you need to specify are the dependencies and namespaces.
Here's the definition for [Emmy](https://github.com/mentat-collective/emmy):

```edn
 :emmy {:namespaces [emmy.env]
        :deps {org.mentat/emmy {:mvn/version "0.32.0"}}}
```

Building and releasing plugins can make the ClojureScript ecosystem more accessible from Scittle,
people making cool stuff, more fun, less headaches, and wider adoption.

## Contributing

Pull requests are invited.
Add new plugins in [`plugin-templates.edn`](plugin-templates.edn) or create a new directory in `plugins/`.
For most libraries, just add an entry to [`plugin-templates.edn`](plugin-templates.edn).

## Development

For local development:

1. Check out the latest Scittle code (the GitHub Action does this automatically):
  ```bash
  git submodule update --init --remote
  ```
2. Build:
  ```bash
  bb build
  ```
  Or build a single plugin (faster for development):
  ```bash
  bb build <plugin-name>
  ```
  Or build multiple plugins:
  ```bash
  bb build <plugin1> <plugin2> ...
  ```

## Deploying

Releases are done as a GitHub Action, which pushes to the `gh-pages` branch, published by GitHub Pages.
See [.github/workflows/release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml).

## Build Process Design

To build Scittle (and plugins), ensure that scittle and all the plugins you want are on the classpath,
and invoke the scittle build function: `(build/build)`.
Scittle discovers plugins by scanning the classpath for plugin descriptors,
and produces javascript files in `resources/public/js`.

Below details how `scittle-kitchen` achieves this situation by preparing the deps for a build.

- **Local Scittle Dependency:**
  Problem: we want to use the latest version of Scittle and be able to run `build/build` and find `scittle/plugins`.
  Solution: use a git submodule and a `:local/root "scittle"` dependency.
  Note that `:local/root "scittle/build"` is also required as a dependency as that is not included in just scittle.
  When run as a GitHub Action, the workflow always checks out the latest Scittle code from your repository,
  so builds and plugins are always up-to-date with the most recent changes.

- **SCI Version Synchronization:**
  Problem: there is a conflict between the SCI Maven version and the Scittle git dependency of SCI.
  Solution: the build script copies the version of `org.babashka/sci` from `scittle/deps.edn` to ensure compatibility. Without this, the build will fail.

- **Automatic Plugin Generation:**
  Problem: we want to avoid boilerplate and make it easy to add new plugins.
  Solution: the [`build.clj`](src/scittle_kitchen/build.clj) script generates plugins from a concise data description in [`plugin-templates.edn`](plugin-templates.edn).
  This works for simple plugins.
  For most libraries, just to `plugin-templates.edn`.
  If your plugin requires more complex setup, you can create a full plugin directory in `plugins/` rather than generating it,
  or we can add optional fields to the template in the future.

- **Automatic Plugin Discovery:**
  Problem: in order to add plugins to the classpath, we need to find them and create a `deps.edn`.
  Solution: directories in `plugins/` and `scittle/plugins/` (excluding `demo`) are detected as dependencies.
  New plugins are included in the build without changes to the build process.

- **Separate build directories:**
  Problem: we want to be able to build different versions of Scittle with different plugin sets.
  Solution: [`build.clj`](src/scittle_kitchen/build.clj) can generate multiple build directories with different sets of plugins.
  Each build directory has its own `deps.edn` and `bb.edn`.
  Note that both are required. scittle/build is babashka only, so it needs to be in `bb.edn`.
  `deps.edn` is required when scittle/build launches Clojure to do the shadow-cljs build.
  The default build is `all`, which includes all plugins.
  Inside that directory, `bb release` will produce a build with all plugins. This enables easy experimentation and custom builds.

- **Versioning Scheme:**
  Each `scittle-kitchen` build is assigned a version of the form: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-BUILD
  - `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` is taken from the latest Scittle tag (e.g., 0.7.27)
  - `BUILD` is the git commit count of the scittle-kitchen repository at build time
  For example, if the latest Scittle tag is `0.7.27` and the current commit count is `1234`, the version will be `0.7.27-1234`

- **Future Improvements:**
  - It might be better to have the build process checkout the latest Scittle code itself,
    rather than relying on the GitHub Action to do so.
  - Support versioned builds, e.g. `all-0.4.0`, `official-0.4.0`, etc.
  - Think about using latest versions of the libraries that plugins depend on.
    Right now, they are pinned in `plugin-templates.edn`.
  - Publish to NPM or a CDN

## Alternatives considered

- Could be part of the scittle repo itself, as a different build task.
  NO: adds too much maintenance burden on @borkdude
- [https://github.com/scicloj/scittle](https://github.com/scicloj/scittle) is a fork instead of using submodule.
  NO: harder to keep up with latest Scittle changes, not clear how to add plugins.
- Publishing to NPM or CDN. YES (soon): could be done in addition to GitHub Pages.
- How to update plugin dependencies? TBD for now they are pinned in `plugin-templates.edn`.
  Could be done automatically by checking for new versions on Clojars.
- Should plugin builds be versioned? TBD for now there will just be a global version I think.
- Shouldn't all plugins have their own directory/edn file? YES to enable standalone building.
  But we can make it more convenient by generating from a template.
- Should it produce scittle-kitchen.js or just scittle.js or several flavors (is there an advantage to excluding plugins)? TBD. I think it should have a different name to avoid confusion with the official scittle.js, but it's easier to just leave it alone.
